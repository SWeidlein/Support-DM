	<h4>What is a Sim Ticket</h4>
	<p>Sim Tickets are similar to cases in their actions. However its primarily used to communicate site shut downs,ITR and TA requests, along with managing adhocs. This can be used to relay information to drivers on when a site will reopen along with submitting a ticket for an ITR/TA</p>
	<h4>The Process of Securing an ITR or TA tech</h4>
	<p>An ITR can only be submitted for AZNG trailers, if the carrier is using their own trailer please receive an ETA for trailer and/or tractor repairs. Similarly TA's are only initiated for AZNG trailers if the trailer is still on site and its loaded please submit a ticket if it is an empty please notifiy site personnel and have driver depart with a different trailer.</p>
